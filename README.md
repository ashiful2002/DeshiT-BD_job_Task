# DeshiT-BD Landing Page  
Though the task title was "MERN Project Development"
But there was nothing but designing a landing page. So i just designed the landing page. 
But here the most tricky part was to design the digital marketing section, it takes too much time to design but i can't make it perfect as the Figma design. I just did what I could. If it will be a full MERN or CRUD operational project, this will be easy for me to do. 

A modern, responsive landing page built with **React + Vite** for the company **DeshiT-BD**. The design focuses on performance, clean UI, and smooth user experience.
